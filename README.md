## App to reproducte interactive videos from Netflix
Netflix decided time ago to get rid of interactive series/movies from the platform and not give any way to still reproduce them, inspired by
https://github.com/Eveep23/Interactive-Player/  I decided to create a player to support those media in Android.

#### Tested content
- Headspace guided-meditation videos ( Spanish ) 

## TODO:
- [] Dashboard UI to display all your content
- [] Use original images buttons for each media
- [] Fix some choices
- [] Icon app lol
- [x] Use dynamic video ID's
