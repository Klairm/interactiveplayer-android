## App to reproducte interactive videos from Netflix
Netflix decided time ago to get rid of interactive series/movies from the platform and not give any way to still reproduce them, inspired by
https://github.com/Eveep23/Interactive-Player/  I decided to create a player to support those media in Android.

#### CURRENTLY IN POOR STATE!
This app currently uses hardcoded ID (bad) so it will only work with the Headspace guided-meditation videos 


## TODO:
- [] Dashboard UI to display all your content
- [] Use original images buttons for each media
- [] Fix some choices
